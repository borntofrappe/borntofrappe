At the risk of being obsessive, I often stumble on the difference between accuracy and precision. The two share a common core, a propensity for being exact, but are quite different in nature. And what better way to remark the difference than with a few visuals? Another example where scalable vector graphics just shine.

First off, precision. The word describes the state of being exact, and technically being exact over and over. Think of multiple measurements marking the same value. Think of a shower of arrows, gathered around the same spot.

<Center element="figure" maxInlineSize="26rem">
    {@html svg['precision']}
</Center>

What is accuracy, then? Why, accuracy is just one arrow. One arrow leaving a slim bow, flying through the air and hitting the target with forceful grace. Exact. Once.

<Center maxInlineSize="36rem">
    <PerfectShot />
</Center>

Accurate? It certainly is.
