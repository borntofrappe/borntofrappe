Small, round, friendly. The keywords of the Zdog library listed [in the accompanying website](https://zzz.dog/) cue up the project incredibly well. And it is in these features, in the same inclination the library has for experimentation as SVG, that I've found a sweet playground for pseudo-3D graphics.

Past articles relied on the module to put a visual to words, to introduce core elements such as [depth](/z-overlap), or again to illustrate higher concepts such as [rotations over three axes](/rotate-3d).

This article does nothing of the sort. It is an excuse to begin a series, a journey to simply marvel at gorgeous pseudo-3D art. I decided to dub the initiative _"Zdog monday"_, to avoid sounding overly pretentious and hopefully remove any doubts about scheduling. And I've decided to ease in the series with a small, rounded piece. And a friendly reminder to appreciate the power of a good sleeping session.
