brief: This website takes advantage of three fonts. Here's how they are included in the stylesheet.

Experimenting with different typefaces, I finally settled to use three fonts:

| Font            | Type       |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Maven Pro       | sans-serif |
| Ubuntu          | sans-serif |
| Source Code Pro | monospace  |

There is a rationale behind each pick, especially regarding the weight and style chosen for each pick, but here, I'd like to briefly describe how I chose to incorporate the fonts in the stylesheet of each page.

## font-face

- rule
- code snippets

## google fonts

- url
- alphabet
- unicode-range

## font strategy

spent a lot of time designing SVG icons, but the website is mostly text

it pays dividend to consider the appropriate font to match the mood of the website, and it perhaps even more to consider how the fonts are ultimately delivered

More research is warranted
