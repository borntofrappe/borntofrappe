Per the season, it is fitting to remark the passing of time with a calendar. But it is cumbersome to show more than a handful of days at a time, so I decided to give a different twist on a familiar feat. This begs two questions:

1. just how many times can you rotate a graphic on the y axis and still have the effect mildly entertaining?

2. can you really come up with twenty plus shapes to keep the theme alive?

The first question is almost too easy to answer â€” a lot. Assuming the code works as intended, today's entry should be more than proof.

The second question is quite more daunting. I'm not that imaginative, but I think I can come up with a few more examples. Just don't expect them on a daily basis, however. The weekend is the perfect time to prepare a fresh batch, and it might take one more day to accept the result.
