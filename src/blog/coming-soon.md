This is just a test. Hopefully, I'll have the courage to replace such a placeholder by writing about what I like to build with code:

- websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. With the added convenience of utilities like React, or again Svelte

- data visualizations with SVG and D3

- scripts with Python

- games with Lua and Love2D
