## Why SvelteKit

Because **Svelte**.

## Why Svelte

Because **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Why all that

Because the web:

- content

- style

- interactivity

I have a tremendous appreciation for the three languages. Add SVG to the mix, and you paint a truly, pretty picture.

## Why SVG

Honestly, this is where the question starts to be pointless. I don't know why SVG. I find the vector syntax to be exceedingly beautiful. Draw a line from here to here. Draw a rectangle, only the stroke however, round the corners while you are at it. It is declarative, but somehow immensely and immediately rewarding. It starts to be a tad more challenging once you start to consider bezier curves and arcs, but you can achieve so much with so little. At the end of the day, the best reason I can give to me enjoying scalable, vector, graphics might just come from a well animated movie.

I'll leave you to find the source.
