If you are reading this article, chances are you share a liking for vector graphics. In the blog, there is no shortage of material devoted to the topic, and the results are often remarkable. Possibly pointless, but always intriguing.

There is _a lot_ you can achieve writing SVG by hand and relying on the SVG specification only, but there are features which extend the scope of the language. Or at least, features where a scripting language like JavaScript help to make a much more attainable reality. For instance: 3D shapes. You can add a sense of depth with a judicious use of color or again size. You can even play with [different projections](/picross-projection) to branch into fresh new directions, but when it comes to higher dimensions, there are libraries to ease the task.

The end-all be-all seems to be [three.js](https://threejs.org/). The wall of projects you find in the landing page is enough to occupy you for a solid afternoon, but I find the library as exciting as overlwheming.

For a softer introduction, [Zdog](https://zzz.dog/) promises to escape the second dimension with a more approachable API. Better yet, the library works with a `<canvas>` or an `<svg>` element. And we're quite acquainted with the latter.

## Ready

It is easy to tinker without aim, so it is better to have clear goal: take a vector and recreate the shapes in pseudo-3D.

For the SVG, a few websites offer illustrations to decorate your content, and [themeisle](https://themeisle.com/illustrations/) has an impressive showcase which fits our needs. The visuals are beefy enough to challenge the 2D label already, and simple enough we can draw them ourselves with a handful of elements.

{@html svg['code-snippets']}

A few `<path>`s, several more `<circles>`s. There's nothing inherently complex about the syntax. And do not worry, you'll get the opportunity to appreciate the elements and attributes as we recreate the shapes with the library.

## Set

We have our SVG, with a fixed `width` and `height`.

```html
<svg width="400" height="300">
	<!-- ...gorgeous artwork -->
</svg>
```

I tend to rely on the `viewBox` attribute to size most vectors, but as Zdog begins with fixed measures I decided to stick to the example.

With JavaScript, you are going to target the node to create an illustration.

```js
const element = document.querySelector('svg');
const illustration = new Zdog.Illustration({
	element
});
```

You add shapes on this illustration with other classes, always from the `Zdog` object.

```js
new Zdog.Ellipse({
	addTo: illustration
});
```

Finally, you complete the picture with one essential method: `updateRenderGraph`.

```js
illustration.updateRenderGraph();
```

The process is rather intuitive, and we can almost start drawing, but there is one short stop before we get there. One instruction which will simplify our work at length. 

In a Zdog illustration you draw the shapes from the center of the canvas. In the `<svg>` element, I drew the artwork from the top left corner. 

```html
<svg width="400" height="300">
<circle transform="translate(30 210)"  r="7" />
<!-- ... -->
</svg>
```

Now, you can adapt the values to the new origin. If there is a circle drawn 30 units right, 210 units down from the top left, you can certainly figure our where to position the shape from the center. A quick subtraction should solve the issue. 

But we have JavaScript at our disposal, and in the spirit of making life easier, and doing less work in the process, there is a better way. 

In SVG, you have group elements as general, helpful containers. With Zdog, you have a group class with a similar purpose. 

```js
const group = new Zdog.Group({
//... 
})
```

The idea is then simple. Create a group and add it to the illustration. 

```js
const group = new Zdog.Group({
	addTo: illustration
})
```

Apply a translation to this group,  moving the origin back to the top left corner. 

```js
const group = new Zdog.Group({
	addTo: illustration,
translate: { x: -200, y: -150 }
})
```

When it comes to drawing shapes, then, add them to the group itself. . 

```js
new Zdog.Ellipse({
	addTo: group,
	translate: { x: 30, y: 210 }
});
```

Code. Making life easier.

## Lift off

Around the makeshift folder you find a series of dots. And in SVG, these are drawn with `<circle>`elements at different x, y, coordinates.

```html
<circle transform="translate(30 210)"  r="7" />
<circle transform="translate(30 210)"  r="7" />
```

I repeated the element with an arbitrary radius and positioned the dots with the `transform` attribute, trying as much as possible to mirror the original illustration. To add a touch of variety, then, I took advantage of the attribute to scale the figures as well.

```html
<circle transform="translate(30 210) scale(0.9)"  r="7" />
<circle transform="translate(30 210) scale(1.6)"  r="7" />
```

In Zdog, we can recreate the dots with an ellipse, the first class explained in the docs, but a `Shape` is the best class to draw a perfect sphere. A `Shape` with a positive stroke.

```js
new Zdog,Shape({
	addTo: group,
stroke: 14,
translate
})
```

You can draw one sphere in a spot, and then repeat the process for the other copies. And once again, we can set ourselves up to success with some logic.

One array, describing the position and scale of the particles. You can very well copy the values from the `transform` attribute since we took care to reposition the group.

```
```

One loop, cycling through the data structure to extract the values and inject them in the class.

```js
new Zdog,Shape({
	addTo: group,
stroke: 14,
})
```

There is a dot sized issue, however, for the actual scale. Zdog supports a `scale` property, in the same fashion as `translate`. Even if you add the line, however, the spheres do not change in size. 

The problem: [`scale` does not work on the stroke](/). But there's always a solution, and in this instance, you can work around the issue in a rather dumb way. If the scale property does not update the stroke, you can update the stroke yourself. 

Instead of scaling the class, the figure, resize the stroke, the diameter.

```js
new Zdog,Shape({
	addTo: group,
stroke: 14 * scale,
})
```

Problem, solved.

On to more complex shapes â€” this might be a soft introduction, but we want to reach for the sky.

Always around the folder you find a couple of particles. Just two of them, but their presence is more than welcomed. For these, you have to thank a `<path>` element drawing a star with four arcs.

```
<path d="M" />
```

One `<path>`, repeated twice at different x, y coordinates, exactly as the circles. To this end, we can repeat some of the logic. 

One data structure, detailing the sparkles.

```
```

One loop, extracting the values and drawing a shape.

Not a circle, however. And therefore, not through the stroke alone. In Zdog, `stroke`is essential to add depth. And in the context of a `Shape`, if you rely on the only on the stroke you end up with a perfect sphere.

To draw more complex figures, the key is the `path` property.

```
```

A point to start, an arc to follow.

Except, once again we stumble of a small obstacle. I might have drawn my particle with arcs, but in the `d` attribute, I decided to draw them with _relative_ numbers.

From 5 units left, draw an arc 5 units right and above.

In Zdog, the coordinates refer  to_absolute_ measures.

From 5 units left, draw an arc 5 units from the center, _10_ units distant. Always above, but way off center.

And this time, there is no shortcut. You need to adjust the values by hand. And the next time, consider absolute numbers when writing SVG as well SVG. At least when you plan to move to Zdog.

Arc after arc, you are able to recreate the sparkle, but then need a stroke. A fixed stroke in this instance.

In this instance, `scale` does work to resize the shape. 

Let's move on to the center piece, the folder smack in the center of the illustration. For this, we have three `<path>` elements, and starting with the two brackets right in the middle, we get to know another interesting part of the Zdog library.

In SVG, you can draw the brackets with two separate paths, two distinct `d` attributes. Or, create just the one, and repeat the same with a negative scale.

```
```

You are essentially flipping the coordinate system around the `x` axis. The first path might draw an arrow to the left, but the mirrorred version points to the right.

And in Zdog, the logic is conveniently similar. You can draw the brackets with two separate classes, two distinct `path` properties. Or, create just the one.

```

```

Keep a reference of the class in a variable.

Repeat the shape with the `copy` function and the still-working, negative `scale`.

I know you are ready to throw in the towel, but in one last stretch, try consider the final piece. The bulky folder in the background...

```
```

You might be staring at the snippet with dread. And for a good reason. As I drew the illustration I kept using lowercase characters, I kept using relative numbers. And if the Zdog library does allow to create bezier curves with a `bezier` key, I won't subject you to the manual conversion between the instructions.

You've endured enough, and are more than excused to reap the rewards.

To get started, you can change the rotation of the illustration, on one of the possible axis. The good news is that every shape will rotate from the center even if you where cheeky enough to drew add the classes from somewhere else. 

The result? I don't have it. There isn't even a plot twist where you find the original graphic at the top of the page was pseudo-3D all along. I have the multi-dimensional example [on CodePen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/abQdyoR), and you'll need to visit my profile to be impressed. I might not have a wall of projects, but you might be entertained by a few demos...

Anticlimactic? I get it. And as I often remedy these situations, let me offer you something new to send you off on a higher note. 

<CosmicAdventure />

The really good news?  You can very well create something similar all on your own. I tried to animate the piece all on my own, but outside of the smooth change, the logic is eerily similar. 

Take a moment to appreciate the docs and you are primed and ready for adventure. Primed and ready to explore the dimensions. x, y and z.
