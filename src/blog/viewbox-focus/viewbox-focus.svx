<Intro />

To reintroduce the topic, let me start by updating the past effort. To update the origin of the canvas we dragged a handle, and longed for a true dragging feature. Revisiting [pointer events](/get-to-the-point), I tried to accomplish the feat with JavaScript and Svelte, so you won't have to wish for the experience much longer â€” feel free to grab and drag the chart to explore the data at your heart's content.

<Center maxInlineSize="30rem">
    <Pointer />
</Center>

## Zoom

Remarkable how it might be, even the draggable line chart updates only one value, the horizontal origin.

```svelte
<svg viewBox="{x} 0 130 130">
	<!-- ... -->
</svg>
```

Behind the scenes, we reduced the width of the canvas, scaling down the value from the measure necessary to show the line chart in full.

```diff
-<svg viewBox="0 0 530 130">
+<svg viewBox="0 0 130 130">
```

Ultimately we picked an arbitrary value, but if you allow to change the width similarly to the origin, you are able to zoom in the visual with much more freedom.

To prove the concept, let's forget the line chart and consider a different plot, a scatter plot.

<ScatterPlot />

Here we have plenty of points, scattered over two axis and sometimes too close to each other. In terms of `viewBox`, the attribute sets up a perfectly square canvas, 100 units wide and tall.

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100">
	<!-- ... -->
</svg>
```

Change the width and the height, halving both values, and you zoom in in the first quadrant.

```diff
-<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100">
+<svg viewBox="0 0 50 50">
```

Further, modify the origin and you get to explore the rest of the chart. As with the line chart, if you inset the horizontal measure, you move to the right.

```diff
-<svg viewBox="0 0 50 50">
+<svg viewBox="50 0 50 50">
```

Update the vertical component, and you get to move the focus downwards as well.

```diff
-<svg viewBox="50 0 50 50">
+<svg viewBox="50 50 50 50">
```

Finding the four quadrants is then a matter of adjusting the x and y origin. A visual might help.

<Center element="figure" maxInlineSize="24rem">
	{@html svg['view-boxes']}
</Center>

And with JavaScript and Svelte, an interactive, animated demo is sure to convince you of the usefulness of the concept.

<ViewBox />

<Center element="figure" maxInlineSize="32rem">
	<PetriDish />
</Center>
