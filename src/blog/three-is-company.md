brief: Because the blog page needed three articles to show the grid. If grid properties are supported that is.

The Styrian Gran Prix ended up quite differently from what I expected in [the first filler article](/blog/getting-started).

| Driver           | Prediction | Position |
| ---------------- | ---------: | -------: |
| Max Verstappen   |          1 |        1 |
| Lewis Hamilton   |          2 |        2 |
| Valtteri Bottas  |          3 |        3 |
| Lando Norris     |          4 |        5 |
| Sergio Perez     |          5 |        4 |
| Daniel Ricciardo |          6 |       13 |
| Charles Leclerc  |          7 |        7 |
| Sebastian Vettel |          8 |       12 |
| Lance Stroll     |          9 |        8 |
| George Russel    |         10 |      ... |

I was quite too hopeful for a few drivers. Better luck next time.
