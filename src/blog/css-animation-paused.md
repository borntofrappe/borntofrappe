## Animation

The idea is to animate an icon only when the hover or focus state is registered on a neighboring button. And to avoid the abrupt change coming from registering/removing the state.

This is some `code` you have.

Let me try again.

```script.js
let name = "Gabriele";
name = "Gabrie"; // this is supposed to cause horizontal scroll

name += "le Corti";
```

```style.css
p {
  margin-top: 1rem;
}
```

This is some normal css

```css
p {
  margin-top: 1rem;
}
```

## What's more

I just need some filler text here.

### Another one

This heading should be smaller, but always have a permalink option.
