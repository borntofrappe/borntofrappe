I don't have a real blog post to begin this adventure, so I'll just try to round up the top ten for the Styrian grand prix, starting approximately ten minutes from when I hit save.

| Position | Driver           | Team         |
| -------: | ---------------- | ------------ |
|        1 | Max Verstappen   | Red Bull     |
|        2 | Lewis Hamilton   | Mercedes     |
|        3 | Valtteri Bottas  | Mercedes     |
|        4 | Lando Norris     | McLaren      |
|        5 | Sergio Perez     | Red Bull     |
|        6 | Daniel Ricciardo | Mclaren      |
|        7 | Charles Leclerc  | Ferrari      |
|        8 | Sebastian Vettel | Aston Martin |
|        9 | Lance Stroll     | Aston Martin |
|       10 | George Russel    | Williams     |

Good luck George!
