<script>
  let value = 1;
  let count = 0;
</script>

Here's a nice counter: **{count}**

You can <button on:click={() => count = count + value}>increment</button>, <button on:click={() => count = count - value}>decrement</button>, and even decide how much to change the counter with each button press. Currently, by <input type="number" bind:value />.
