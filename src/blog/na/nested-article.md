brief: Testing a more elaborate setup where an article is nested in a folder.
---

Instead of writing `blog/nested-article.md` this entry is placed in `blog/nested-article/nested-article.md`. I'm debating whether or not to extend the logic to consider `/blog/folder/index.md` instead of repeating the name of the folder.

What matters as of now is the name of the file. `/blog/na/nested-article.md` would produce the same result serving the content in `/blog/nested-article`
