brief: A test article to double check how mdsvex marks up markdown syntax

If everything goes as expected this page should have sub-headings with a permalink anchor. Code fences should also be highlighted in color.

## Does it work?

You tell me

```js
const config = {
	preprocess: mdsvex(mdsvexConfig)
};
```

```html
<header>
	<h1>Hello world</h1>
	<h1>Hello world</h1>
	<h1>Hello world</h1>
	<h1>Hello world</h1>
</header>
```
