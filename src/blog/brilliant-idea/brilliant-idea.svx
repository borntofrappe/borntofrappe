<Intro />

It may so happen you'll visit this page on a different day. It's up to you to then reach the proper, long awaited date and unwrap the present in all its dimensions.

It's a very small thought, mind you, but I hope you'll appreciate the gesture. Who knows, you might enjoy it even more going through the process yourself.

I followed the guidance of someone I trust that you don't have to be extravagant to create something beautiful. There's a time for rapidly intermittent lights, strobing in red and orange, green and blue, but there's also a place for nuance, for delightful displays and delicate changes.

The hope is that these will work when at the center there's a sincere feeling, a heartfelt token sending you off with the best of wishes. And the merriest of greetings.
