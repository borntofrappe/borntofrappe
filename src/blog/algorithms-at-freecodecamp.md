The freeCodeCamp curriculum proposes [hundreds of exercises](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/) to prepare for a coding interview.

With a series of articles I try to complete the challenges and explain my reasoning for the section devoted to _algorithms_:

- [find the symmetric difference](/blog/find-the-symmetric-difference)

- [inventory update](/blog/inventory-update)

- no repeats please

- [pairwise](/blog/pairwise)

- [implement bubble sort](/blog/implement-bubble-sort)

- [implement selection sort](/blog/implement-selection-sort)

- [implement insertion sort](/blog/implement-insertion-sort)

- [implement quick sort](/blog/implement-quick-sort)

- implement merge sort

- [implement binary search](/blog/implement-binary-search)
