brief: The first article of an aspiring developer, fledging designer, long-distance runner

## Briefly

In late April 2020, I went through a bit of a rough patch. In light of this, I abandoned twitter, the #100daysofcode challenge, and decided to refocus my efforts on one single project: this very website. I'm quite proud of the end result, and hopefully, it'll get better from here on out.

## Origin

- React & Gatsby
- Svelte & Sapper
- Eleventy

Eleventy, HTML, CSS, a single JS script and a ton of SVG syntax.

## What to expect

I haven't figured out anything yet. Gosh, this website is tentative to say the least, but here a few technologies I am currently exploring and or mastering:

- svg

- d3

- svelte

Truth be told, anything on the front-end of web development, and that comprises a wide range of topics, is fair game. I've started with HTML, CSS and JS, but I've been fortunate enough to experiment with a variety of libraries, frameworks and utilities. I've also dabbled with a bit of back-end development, but that is a story for another day.

The focus of this website is mainly on the blog. I have a few articles in mind: one on a CSS property, one on the className API. Beside this, the website as a whole is missing a few features:

- a 404 page. Still working on an illustration

- syntax highlighting. Once I grasp how to include shiki and its async logic in the config file, that is.

- a better article to introduce the website.

To be completely honest, this is not the first article I intend to publish, and it's just plenty of filler words to ultimately see how the page will look like.
