## What to expect

- HTML, CSS, JS

- SVG, D3, Svelte

Everything else connected to web development, plus a musing or two about other technologies:

- lua and love2d for 2d game development

- python as an alternative language, specifically in the context of data munging

**Be warned**: the other blog post is a test, to see how the project styles tables, code snippets and a full-feature article.
