title: Petit souris

As I learn French reading the daily news I become more and more aware of how _attached_ French people are to their own native tongue.

I am positive there is a similar preference in any country trying to cope with the spread and dominance of the English language, but the sentiment in France is so strong you will frequently find articles celebrating the vocabulary and even providing alternatives to anglo-saxon expressions.

The sentiment is also so common and shared you will find comments discussing how this or that article had the gumption to use a foreign term instead of a perfectly valid, much more expressive French word.

And of course there are some blatant examples which eventually make you smile. The mouse connected to a computer? In Italy people yielded to the English version, but in France you will still find people parading _souris_. The computer in the first place is better understood as _ordinateur_.

As I first approached the language I couldn't help but feel annoyed by this tendency. Eventually, though, I fell victim to the charm and richness from _la langue de Molière_.

I definitely have to double check the accent of every other word with a letter _e_, but I am almost glad to pay the price knowing I have the opportunity of discovering small gems as the following, most practical, saying.
