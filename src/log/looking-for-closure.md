title: Looking for closure
entry: 13
---

I've had quite a couple of eventful, and admittedly tiring days. In these days I've decided to:

1. revisit the Python language. Third time's the charm

2. complete a book on CSS layout. A book I've started long ago and never actually managed to finish

Completing things is actually my aspiration for the rest of the year. I've started slowly, but I'm ramping up the efforts to find closure for many of the projects I just started out of a whim. How it's going so far. Well:

- I'm three chapters deep in the book. Not much progress there

- I've 750+ lines worth of notes on the Python language. Quite a hefty production

And remember the circuit I've outlined in the last entry, [surprisingly simple](/log/surprisingly-simple)? Well, I went ahead and created the remaining 20 tracks for the 2021 season. I've no use for them, which is slightly depressing, but I might.
