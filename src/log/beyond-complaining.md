In a past entry I lamented the fact that SvelteKit had a broken feature. I was slightly upset by the fact, but eventually I decided to do something about it. I researched the topic in more detail and found an actual, possibly genuine solution.

If it took a lot for the to realize the feature was broken in the first place, it took me at least five more time to cope with it, but eventually cope with it I did. What's more, there a fresh pull request sent to the main repository with trepidation, a mixture of fear and genuine pride.

And _all_ it took was reporting my findings. _All_ it took was researching a method on the **MDN** docs. _And_ diving into three to four questions on **stackoverflow**. _And_ more research on custom events and how they actually work. _And_ creating a small demo to reproduce the issue, implement a solution and reuse the same logic in the main repo. _And_ failing before getting re-aquainted with event bubbling. _And_ follow the guidance of a maintainer all the way through often annoying linting errors. Very little indeed.
