title: Un risque a courir
---

There are several expressions which could have fitted in the title of this entry — all of them French:

- faire exprés

- avec le sourire

- le pari de l'espoir

Each has its own purpose.

Each has also one most practical feat, coming from newspapers 55 days old.

Not one newspaper, mind you, but several written pages.

55 days old, though? That might strike you as the more entertaining portion after all.

The goal is simple: learn French.

It takes practice, time, and in my personal experience different resources. One of these resources: la revue de presse, the review of the written word published on a daily basis by a newspaper. Or again, newspapers. Plural.

The plurality helps a lot, not just to garnish your vocabulary, but also get acquainted with different writing styles, gain a multitude of perspectives.

You can cherry pick an article you find inspiring, and the epxressions above might tesity to that.

You can choose a single topic and see how the same news can be interpreted, can be reported with a certain phlem, with a certain purpose.

Good, but still doesn't answer the question. 55 days. No particular reason for that. A mixture of personal preference — I personally enjoy the review more when it is detached from the most recent happenings — and a matter of access. The beginning of the year seems like a good place to start as well. Give or take three days. Give. Definitely give.
