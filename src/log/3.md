As the month of December brings about the advent period the neighbourhood becomes alive with lights of varying intensity. Some shine in elegant white. Some fight the darkness with a subtle blue. Some sparkle with an intermittent array of colors.

As the merry season comes to a close the illumination gradually disappears. One by one people turn off the lights. Some immediately, at the very beginning of the new year. Some at the end first week of January, by epiphany or plain old common sense. There are some, however, who don't seem to pick up the hint, some who seem to really appreciate a bit of flair in the somber hours of the night. You find a few of these oblivious examples, a few these spots in a sea of darkness, just close by. Small, flickering lights proudly brightening up a balcony or offering a glimmer of life to a shrub.

I've grown to appreciate these exceptions. I've started looking for them, actually, day after day as I make the rounds early in the morning. Eventually, I've also realized it will be a bittersweet moment when all of them will succumb to the harsh reality of the passing of time, to the growing influence of the sun. Close to thirty days later, however, I've also realized that it won't be today.
