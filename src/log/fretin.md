That's how an article from [leparisien.fr](https://www.leparisien.fr/environnement/leau-est-plus-chaude-les-courants-ont-change-pourquoi-la-taille-des-sardines-a-diminue-en-mediterranee-13-11-2021-MBAIRIRJOBGOJDDTPCUHT4MW4M.php) described sardines out of the Mediterranean sea, increasingly smaller in size.

There's something so charming, so sweet about the expression that I had to stop and take notice.

The accent, the cadence, the enunciation play a big role, but just the vocabulary is enough to remind me how rich the French language can be. It's delightful, it's evocative, it's French.

The more I get to know <em lang="fr">la langue de Moli√®re</em>, the more I understand and appreciate the effort of creating new words instead of importing foreign ones.

As I first approach the language I found it almost silly: there's no computer, <em lang="fr">il y'a un ordinateur</em>. There's no mouse, <em lang="fr">il y'a un souris</em>, not just for the rodent, but also for the helpful, pointing device. Especially the pointing device, some might argue.

These days I almost can't help but celebrating these culture capsules. They certainly paint a different picture, and right now remind me of one of the best quotes from one of the sweetest movies.
