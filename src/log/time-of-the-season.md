On the even of the last Grand Prix for the 2021 season I found myself itching to go back to the roots and continue on my journey to complete every title in the Dragon Quest series. If you see the connection that would make one of us. I sat down and wrote a piece on the very first episode, Dragon Warrior 1 and I was almost proud of the end result. So proud I might make it into a full article for the actual blog.

What does the game have to do with myself as a web developer? For once, a testament that inspiration can come from anywhere. For twice, proof that I am indeed able to write an article, materializing a series of connected, hopefully reasoned thoughts. Finally, an excuse to inject my know-how as a web developer with an interactive demo or two. After all, and unlike this log, the blog is more elaborate, more refined. That's the goal at least.
