I finished <i>Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</i>. Despite the confounding title — a staple in the Kingdom Hearts universe — and the sometimes repetitive gameplay, I really did enjoy my time wielding the keyblade, collecting all the hearts and munni within my ever expanding reach.

Why am I talking about the game? As you might have guessed, there is a lot of Kingdom Hearts in the design of this log:

- the animation in the main page — you did notice it, right? — is created directly after the animation showing the passing of days in the title

- the concept of a log — quite novel indeed — is mirrors the journal the main character updates every once in a while

I'll let you guess how many days the actual game lasts. 358? 179? For this log, the threshold is much less defined.

The adventure starts <time datetime="2021-11-11T23:29:11">today, November 11, 2021</time>, and it might end <time datetime="2021-11-12T00:29:11">tomorrow</time>. But hopefully some time after that.
