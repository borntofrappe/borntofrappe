I've been playing a lot of <i>Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</i>. Despite the title, a staple in the confusing world of the Kingdom Hearts universe, and the sometimes repetitive gameplay, I really enjoy my time wielding the keyblade and collecting all the hearts and munni around me.

Why am I talking about the game? As you might have guessed, there is a lot of Kingdom Hearts in the design of this page.

- the animation above this text — you did notice it, right? — is created directly after the animation showing the passing of days

- the concept of a log is much inspired by the journal the main character updates every once in a while.

I'll let you guess how many days the actual game lasts. For this log, the script is much less defined. It starts <time datetime="2021-11-11T23:29:11">today, November 11, 2021</time>, and it might end <time datetime="2021-11-12T00:29:11">tomorrow</time>. But hopefully some time after that.
