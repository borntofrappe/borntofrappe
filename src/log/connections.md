title: It's all connected

On the eve of the last Grand Prix for the 2021 season I found myself itching to go back to the roots and continue on my journey to complete every title in the Dragon Quest series. If you see the connection that would make one of us. I sat down and wrote a piece on the very first episode, Dragon Warrior and I was almost proud of the end result. So proud I might make it into a full article for the actual blog.

What does the game have to do with myself as a software developer? Well, here the connection does exist. Aside from proving that inspiration can come from anywhere, it's an excuse to tinker with an interactive demo or two. Validation of my know-how as a web developer, and finally confirmation that I am indeed able to write an article, to materialize a series of connected, hopefully reasoned thoughts. That's the goal at least.
