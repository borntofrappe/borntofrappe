There are some words, some expressions which gain a bright new light when you discover how they came to be.

Consider _entre la poire et le fromage_, literally between the pear and cheese, as a French expression to signal a moment between situations.

The origin is tantamount literal, as it points to a time in which people would eat pears and cheese. Quite interestingly in the specific order. Sweet first, salty food second. It was only later on, as France was faced with the opposite trend from their Spanish neighbors, that the order changed to what we are more accustomed today.

The expression stuck beyond the practice, though, and as you glean at its origins you start to notice the richer meaning, the subtle purpose.

When you are between pears and cheese you are toward the end of the luncheon, you are quite satiated and relaxed. On the other end, you are also faced with a potential conflict between two contrasting flavors. Sure the two might struck a nice balance, but they might also overwhelm each other with disturbing results.

A striking image making for an entertaining factoid. And maybe a lasting entry in your vocabulary.
