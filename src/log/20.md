In trying to be more positive I recently started to keep track of small wins, small victories which brighten up the day.

Case in point, a well established French newspaper covered the winter Olympics with a series of live chats, updating readers with the latest results, but also interacting with the receptive audience. 

In French, to be sure. 

It is no secret I've been trying to master the mellifluous tongue and in this series of streams I've found plenty of room for growth. 

That, and validation of past learnings.

One day before the closing cerimony, among team competitions, I decided to send in a message, then a second and finally a third.

In tentative French, most assuredly.

Five minutes later, wouldn't you know it, there it was. A familiar series of words. Published with a short, supportive comment.

Certainly there might be a joke which flies over my head, a play on words I need to just take as granted. But that small victory is worth a comparable celebration.
