title: The apple of my eyes
---

Here's something which has sparked quite a lively conversation. A pine cone in French is called <span lang="fr">pomme de pin</span> — literally an apple from a pine. Fruit if you interpret the ever present red orb in a more general sense.

In German? <span lang="de">Tannenzapfen</span> — an apple from a sapling. <span lang="de">Apfel</span> being an apple, <span lang="de">apfen</span> the declination if I still remember <span lang="de">ein bisschen Deutsch</span>.

In Italian? <span lang="it">Pigna</span>. There's no apple, there's no fruit. Only the root of the tree is shared — and the pun is a happy accident.

Most of the times I cherish having a single word in place of a composite one. Or in this instance a single word over a combination of few. This time, however, I must admit I prefer having the different parts paint a quite descriptive picture.
