Progress toward the CSS book is stagnating, I'll be brutally honest.

Progress with the Python language, however, is solid and ongoing.

I've completed plenty of challenges in the freeCodeCamp curriculum, created a repository to document the projects to earn the first certification, finished all five projects, earned the certification, and even started a second folder for the next round.

I got re-acquainted with a really attractive language and I dove deeper in two libraries I previously experienced only lightly: NumPy and Pandas.

I still have the source code from the first time I discovered the modules, and I'm genuinely ashamed at parts of it. If I were to explain what changed, other than me growing by approximately one year, it would how I handle frustration, how I handle not knowing the answer to a specific question, say how you find the number of rows in a data frame. Perhaps the example is too specific, but the point stands: faced with the unnerving feeling of being lost I research the topic, explore the documentation and instead of finding the most practical solution, say use the len function, find how to tackle issues at a higher level. What problem am I trying to solve. What problems do the libraries address, and how do they address these problems. It takes more time, it takes more effort, but the results are already showing. Time will tell if the results will be lasting as well.

Take a moment, appreciate what you know, measure what you don't.
