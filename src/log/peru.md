I discovered a couple of things in an otherwise frustrating coding session:

1. <code>peru</code> works as a color in CSS

2. color keywords are case insensitive. You could write <code>tOmAtO</code> and it would still works. I mean, you shouldn't... why should you.. why should you bother...but you could

How did I find out about both? I was trying to map data to a choropleth map... I guess you can fill in the rest.
