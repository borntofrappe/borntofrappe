I might have mentioned a pull request, sent recently to the very same library building this website. A pull request carried out with fear and trepidation. A pull request which took considerable effort, even if the tone of the entry might have tried to pretend otherwise.

Well, the pull request has been accepted, merged, and will be part of the very next version of the kit.

Far from being ecstatic, the feeling is, as you might have guessed from the title of _this_ entry, both sweet and bitter.

Sweet, for my contribution has been recognized.

Bitter, for the solution doesn't fully resolve the underlying issue, doesn't cover all possible edge cases. Worse yet, I fear my tone in the conversation surrounding the pull request might be perceived as close-minded, even hostile toward modifications and criticism.

Handling all possible edge cases is possibly a foolish idea, and I certainly can live with the ramifications. What I find difficult to digest, however, is that other contributors might not realize how appreciative I am just to be considered.

I hope to get over this feeling soon. This entry helped to put words to the situation, and that is certainly a start. The rest is a matter of continue using the library, continue my contributions, no matter how small. If my tone is misconstrued, my actions will hopefully prove otherwise.
