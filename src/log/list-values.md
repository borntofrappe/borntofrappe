title: List values
entry: 2

The frontmatter for each entry describes a title and an arbitrary number. The idea is to use this last integer to immediately sort the entries, but also change the value displayed next to the items in the ordered list highlighting all available entries. The more you know: `<li>` items support a `value` attribute to implement this feature.
