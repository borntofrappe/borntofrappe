Perhaps the callback is too recent, but speaking of HTML attributes which fulfill a particular need: `value`. Not on the `<input>` element, though, on `<li>` elements, list items and list items for ordered lists.

By default the counting is incremental, as you'd expect. Through the attribute, however, you gain access to the individual entries.

Why would you want that? Let's say if you have a log, kinda like this one. Let's say you attach an integer to the entries you write in this log, incrementing the value with each passing day. Let's say, and I'm not setting up anything here, that you fail to write an entry every single day. Well, now you have a way to be honest and admit defeat, to humble yourself. I know it's unlikely, but you know... now you know another way to mark up content.
