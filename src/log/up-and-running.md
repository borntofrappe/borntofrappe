This website does not have a blog. Yet. It does have a log, however. It matters very little, but to me and my memory of a house sparrow it does:

- it is a very convenient place to set up a blog-like environment

  I have markdown documents, I have SvelteKit generate pages with an endpoint, I have `mdsvex` process, or rather pre-process the documents into valid, beautiful markup.

- it is much less structured than a blog

  I can vent, I can ramble, I can just _log_, for lack of a better word. There's something I learn about `mdsvex` and one of its config options? Log it. There's a new HTML attribute which fulfills a particular need? Log it. You get the gist without a third example, I'm positive.

- I can experiment with a spiffy animation

  `/log` introduces the latest entry animating a counter with JavaScript, vector graphics with CSS. I got to tinker with promises, easing functions, even SMIL animation before moving back to CSS. It's honestly a proud result.

It is extremely likely I'm writing for an audience of one, perhaps even less, as I often become weary of what I write. I don't plan to add an anchor link element from the main website, leading to the log, nor easier navigation to move within the log folder. You want to access the content? You have to type the appropriate URL. And if you do, please don't share it ;)
