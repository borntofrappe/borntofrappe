Twice in this past week I was reminded that pink hue I so cherish in the sky, be it at the dawn of a new day or the eve of the current one, that nice tint in the horizon as then sun scrapes by is only there as clouds are.

There's a lesson there, if I can put words to it. There's light not instead of darkness, but because of it. There's relief because there is turmoil. There's serenity because there is anxiety.

Or maybe there's something less pretentious at place. Something more practical and definitely easier to explain.

Were the sky immaculate, were the sky perfectly clear you'd go along without a second look. Were the cloud white pillows, they'd blend in the background. Alas, you do notice them because you don't think them so colorful. You do notice them because they create contrast. You do notice them because they stand out.

And at least twice in this past week, you cannot help but being uplifted. You cannot help but raise your spirit as you admire such a comforting canvas.
