title: Log it!
entry: 1
---

This website does not have a blog. Yet. It does have a log, however. It matters very little, but to me and my memory of a house sparrow it does:

- it is a very convenient place to set up a blog-like environment

  I have markdown documents, I have **SvelteKit** generate pages with an endpoint, I have **mdsvex** process — or maybe pre-process? — the documents into valid, beautiful markup.

- it is much less structured than a blog

  I can vent, I can ramble, I can just _log_ for lack of a better word. There's something I learn about mdsvex and one of its config options? Log it. I discover an HTML attribute which fulfills a particular need? Log it. You get the gist without a third example, I'm positive.

- I can experiment with a spiffy animation

  `/log` introduces the latest entry with a rather complex animation, part JavaScript and part CSS. I got to tinker with promises, easing functions, and on the way with SMIL animation as well before moving back to CSS. It's honestly a proud result.

It is extremely likely I'm writing for an audience of one, perhaps even less, as I often become weary of what I write. I don't plan to add an anchor link element from the main website leading to this log, nor easier navigation to move within the log itself. You want to access the content? You have to type the appropriate URL. And if you do, please don't share it.
