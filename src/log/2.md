This website doesn't have a blog. Yet. What it does have is a **log**, though. What's more, this choice has purpose, and it's not just the result of typo made real.

For starters, I got to set up a blog-like environment with markdown files. SvelteKit looks into a folder, collects the documents with the `.md` extension and renders the content in three routes:

1. `/log/index.svelte`

2. `/log/[day].svelte`

3. `/log/days.svelte`

In the moment I muster enough courage to create a blog and write a good honest article, the setup creates a solid starting point for the more elaborate feature.

On top of this I got to experiment with CSS animation, and you wouldn't know it by the looks of it, SMIL animation as well. It's almost a pity I had to choose between one of the two in the end. I just hope you appreciate the visual in the first route, inspired by one of my most cherished gaming experiences.

Finally, and I wouldn't discount this last factoid, I got to re-discover that _tortoise_ is a countable noun. Good to know if you have more than one.
