In my twisted journey toward becoming a software developer, perhaps a web developer using HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a day to day basis, I started learning about algorithms and data structures.

Progress has been quite... unpredictable I could say. One week I fly through several problems introducing bubble sort, selection sort, the attractive quick sort. One week I struggle to make a doubly linked array just work as intended.

What I am left with is deep appreciation for computer science as a whole. That and the sweet, rewarding feeling of actually solving a problem. That rush of dopamine from having your code work as intended. That satisfaction from having an idea and materializing your vision into reality.
