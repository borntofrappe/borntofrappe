    Right now, I'm enjoying creating this very website, and documenting the
    process
    <a href="https://github.com/borntofrappe/borntofrappe#readme"
      >in the Github repo</a
    >.
  </p>

    Beside this page, I'd like to create a blog, and have the courage to
    actually write a few articles there. The page is already up and running, and
    "all" that is missing is the actual content.
