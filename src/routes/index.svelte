  <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  <p>I enjoy writing code</p>

  <p>
    Right now, I'm enjoying creating this very website, and documenting the
    process
    <a href="https://github.com/borntofrappe/borntofrappe#readme"
      >in the public repo</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beside this page, I'd like to create a blog, and have the courage to
    actually write a few articles there. <a href="/blog">The page</a> is already
    up and running, and "all" that is missing is the actual content.
