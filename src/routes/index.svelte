  <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  <p>I enjoy writing code</p>

  <p>
    Right now, I'm enjoying creating this very website, and documenting the
    process
    <a href="https://github.com/borntofrappe/borntofrappe#readme"
      >in the public repo</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    There's a page for <a href="/blog">the blog</a>, but it's just a
    proof-of-concept for now.
