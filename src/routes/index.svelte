    Right now, I'm enjoying creating this very website, and documenting the
    process
    <a href="https://github.com/borntofrappe/borntofrappe#readme"
      >in the Github repo</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beside this page, I'd like to create a blog, and have the guts to actually
    write a few articles there. The page is already up and running, and <em
      >all</em
    >
    that is missing is the actual content.
