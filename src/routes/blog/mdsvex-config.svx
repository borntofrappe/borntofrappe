brief: Setting up a markdown blog with mdsvex
---

This article need erasing. It will be deleted once I am able to finally write something deserving of attention.

Just an excuse to jot things down as I set up the blog within the context of my SvelteKit app.

## Step 1

Install mdsvex with `npm`.

## Step 2

Create a `/routes/blog/` route with a tenative `.md` and `.svx` document â€” this one, by happenstance.

## Step 3

Update the config object so that svelte processes both file extensions and uses mdsvex to process either.
