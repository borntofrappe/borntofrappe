## Meta Tags

The `<head>` of a document details a series of tags with additional information regarding the page.

Refer to `index.html` for a series of useful tags. Most of the values change depending on which page is being served (consider the attributes left with an empty string `""`), but some tags are shared by every route.

## Twitter images

Images for the twitter platform come in two varieties:

- summary_large image

- summary

Most practically, the two require a different size of the image being used. In the first instance, use an image with a 2:1 aspect ratio, while in the latter one with a 1:1 ratio.

## Article

The tags are useful for blog posts, but less so for the landing page and the page indexing the articles.
