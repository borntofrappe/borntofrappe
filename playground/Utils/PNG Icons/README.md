# PNG Icons

Create `.png` icons for the website.

## vanilla

Using vanilla JavaScript, recreate the syntax behind the letter `b` icon with the canvas API. Use then an anchor link element to download the associated data and obtain the static asset.

## svelte-app

Consider this an update from the vanilla version. Here I focus on the syntax for the rocket icon, and allow to change the size and or color of the soon-to-be static asset.
