# PNG Icons

In creating the website, I found myself with the following issue: having a well designed icon in SVG syntax, and needing the visual in a `.png` format.

With this demo I try to solve this problem through the canvas API.

- recreate the icon in a `canvas` element

- save the canvas as an image

Refer to **vanilla** for the proof of concept behind the project.

Use **svelte-app** to create an icon at different sizes/colors.

## Icon sizes

Following the suggestions from the meta tags folder, consider at least three sizes:

- 16px

- 32px

- 180px
