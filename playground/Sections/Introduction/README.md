# Introduction

- animate illustration when visible

- use link component

## Notes

### Illustration

The illustration is created using the svg syntax from `telescope.svg`, described in this folder, as well as the icons for html, css, js, and svg.

### Animation

The animation rotates the telescope around its hinge, but only as the illustration is visible in the viewport. For this same reason, the `body` pushes the `section` element below the fold.
