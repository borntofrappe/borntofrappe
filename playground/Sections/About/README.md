# About

- use the following icons: world, editor, running, tea, gaming

- animate the illustration only when visible

## Usage notes

### min-height

The demo extends past the viewport to show how the intersection observer API works. The animation plays only as the section is scrolled into view.

### em

The `<p>` and `<h2>` elements use the `em` unit to scale the content according to the `font-size` of the closes element upstream. This is the wrapping `<section>` element.

### Fluid typography

The project implements fluid typography for the wrapping section element, much similarly to the hero section.
