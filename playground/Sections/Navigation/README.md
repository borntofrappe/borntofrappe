At the top of every page, the idea is to include the navigation component described in _Components/Breadcrumb Navigation_ alongside the toggle detailed in _Components/Color Scheme Toggle_.

## Markup

Wrap both components in a `<div>` container to align the two in a flex row.

```html
<div class="navigation">
  <nav></nav>
  <button></button>
</div>
```
