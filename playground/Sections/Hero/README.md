Header for the landing page.

## SVG

Include the syntax described in `hero.svg`. The idea is to add as many icons and whichever icons as needed, and have the graphic adjust. Moreover, the idea is to wrap each icon in an anchor link element, to have the illustration clickable/focusable.

## Intersection observer

The body is stretched in height to force vertical scroll. The idea is to animate the graphic included in the pseudo element only when the `<header>` element is in sight.
