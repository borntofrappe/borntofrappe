# Hero

A header for the landing page.

## Markup

Create an illustration with SVG syntax which includes a series of anchor link elements. Redirect to the different places on which I spend/intend to spend most of my time:

- blog <!-- hopefully soon -->

- codepen

- freecodecamp

- github

- twitter

Next to the illustration, include a bulleted list to describe my current persona.

Include additional elements for assistive technologies and extra context.
