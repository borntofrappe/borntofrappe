# Link

- custom design for landing page

- demand considerable whitespace at the bottom

- override default `:focus`

## Notes

### Rocket

The icon of the rocket is tweaked to have the shape tilted on its right side. In this folder you find the updated version.

### Edge

I'm struggling to replicate the design on Microsoft Edge. Even the color doesn't change on hover, but for the second link only. Requires further examination.
