# Code Snippet

## Markup

The structure described in `index.html` comes from a script using `shiki`.

Modify the renderer to include a `div` as the first child element of the code snippet. Use this container to describe the language of the code.

For the text, consider one of two variants:

- language: `js`

- title.language: `script.js`
