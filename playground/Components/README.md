# Components

In this folder you find the HTML & CSS for most of the website.

Where needed, a script is included to fabricate the necessary markup.

## global.css

In the stylesheet `global.css` you find the property value pairs which are meant to be included globally, for every page. These include the custom properties describing the color palette, a few rules to reset CSS values included by the user agent stylesheet and other convenience rules (as in repeat in different pages).
