# Heading

## Markup

The script populates the body with a series of headings: h2, h3 and h4.

Remember to:

- have the `id` attribute of the heading match the `href` attribute of the nested anchor link.

- describe the purpose of the link to assistive technologies

## Opacity

Style the opacity to reduce the weight of the permalink icon.

Transition the opacity _and_ color.

```css
.permalink {
  transition-property: opacity, color;
}
```
