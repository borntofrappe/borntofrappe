# Table

- add enough margin to offset the height of the `::before` pseudo element (`margin-top`)

- compensate height of the pseudo element when adding `padding` to the first table row

## Usage notes

The `align` attribute is included by `marked.js`, but it's also and apparently deprecated.

Change the alignment of the text using CSS as well.

```css
[align="right"] {
  text-align: right;
}
[align="center"] {
  text-align: center;
}
```
