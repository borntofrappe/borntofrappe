# Landing page

- nav

- hero section

- about section

- footer

## Notes

### Content

Between the hero and about sections, the landing page is supposed to include one or more _project sections_. These are meant to introduce additional routes developed for the website, and for instance the route open sourcing the icons designed with SVG syntax.

### Semantic markup

I replicated the hero section in a `<header>` element, while using the `<section>` element for the about section. This might change in the future.
