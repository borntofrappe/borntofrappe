# borntofrappe

Here's two things about me:

1. I like to start new projects

2. I often fail to follow through past the initial, exciting phase

So here's my personal website, reinforcing the first factoid and hopefully overriding the second.

<details>
<summary><strong>Dev Notes</strong></summary>

## Does it work?

Fingers crossed, it should. Here's a status badge to confirm.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4e7278de-b395-4b4c-a54c-4c12fbd57fc9/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/borntofrappe/deploys)

- [`adapter-netlify`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-netlify)

## Install

```bash
npm init svelte@next
```

- Directory not empty. Continue? y

- Which Svelte app template? Skeleton project

- Use TypeScript? No

- Add ESLint for code linting? Yes

- Add Prettier for code formatting? Yes

```bash
npm install
```

## Develop

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Publish

`npm run build` creates a production version, but it's first necessary to set up an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters).

The application is meant to be deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), hence [`adapter-netlify`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-netlify).

```bash
npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-netlify@next
```

Update `svelte.config.js` to rely on the adapter.

```js
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-netlify';
```

Add a `netlify.toml` config file.

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "build"
```

## Debug - failed build

> Failed during stage `building site`: Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2

Among the warnings in the "Deploy log"

> npm WARN notsup Unsupported engine for @sveltejs/kit@1.0.0-next.201: wanted: {"node":">=14.13"} (current: {"node":"10.24.1","npm":"6.14.12"})

Update `netlify.toml` to require a satisfactory node version.

```toml
[context.production]
  environment = { NODE_VERSION = "14.18.1" }
```

`14.18.1` because it's the version I use to develop the website.

## Debug - failing function

The site is built but the URL returns the following message

> {"errorType":"Runtime.UserCodeSyntaxError","errorMessage":"SyntaxError: Unexpected token '.'",
>
> ...continues

In the console

> Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 502 ()

In the Netlify app and the deploy log there is no warning, but under "Publish deploy" (I wanted to look at the built version) you find the following

> Production: master@5151cbf.
>
> Deployed Functions

Exploring _functions_ you find a `__render` function which produces the error message

> {"errorType":"Runtime.UserCodeSyntaxError","errorMessage":"SyntaxError: Unexpected token

Scavenging the Netlify [docs](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/#functions) and [forum](https://answers.netlify.com/t/build-works-locally-but-not-in-netlify/45438/4) I found
a fix.

Update `netlify.toml` and the `[functions]` field.

```toml
[functions]
  node_bundler = "esbuild"
```

---

With the website successfully deployed through Netlify I shift focus to the design and development of the application. I might turn these words in regular articles, but for now I'm satisfied with a stream of loosely connected thoughts.

## Document icons

SvelteKit includes `static/favicon.png` as the default icon, referencing the asset directly in `src/app.html`

```html
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.png" />
```

In place of this default, and taking inspiration from [this article](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs) shared on [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-favicon-in-2021/) I created an SVG icon to better fit the application. The icon describes a rocket pointing up and to the right. There's a reason why I landed on the rocket, but I'd rather yada-yada the issue for the time being.

In terms of actual design I like to draw my vector graphics in VSCode, so that the syntax is the end result of adjusting values by hand. I don't feel pressured to optimize the end result with SVGO and I'm more than satisfied just removing the unnecessary whitespace. The icon itself has a default stroke color, but changes for a dark color preference. The colors refer to the following `hsl` codes:

- hsl(210, 24%, 16%)

- hsl(213, 32%, 88%)

Hex colors just take less characters to type.

Returning to the cited article, the markup references the vector graphic, but also `.ico` and `.png` variants.

```html
<link rel="icon" href="/icons/favicon.ico" sizes="any" />
<link rel="icon" href="/icons/icon.svg" type="image/svg+xml" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/icons/apple-touch-icon.png" />
```

The variants are created with GIMP. This relates to the `.ico` and `.png` files included in the snippet, but also the two images referenced in the web manifest. `.png` images are optimized with [squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app/) compressing with OxiPNG and toggling the "Reduce palette" option with 64 colors. The three go from 37.8kb to 12.5kb. I know the browser only needs one, but the difference is noticeable.

## Webfonts

From [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) I picked:

- JosefinSans, only in its semibold variant

- Jost, considering the regular, semibold and italic variants

I don't load a `monospace` webfont and instead prefer to rely on the system font stack. Inconsolata is my preferred option, but it's used only if already available on the machine.

With [fontsquirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator) I created the `woff` and `woff2` file formats, changing a few options in the process:

- keep existing true type hinting

- do not fix GASP table

- no adjustment for vertical metrics

- do not fix missing glyphs, either spaces or hyphens

I don't like the idea that the generator meddles with the typeface, especially considering the vertical measure.

The fonts are placed in the `static` folder and loaded `app.html` following the one-step loading strategy explained in [a comprehensive guide to webfonts](https://www.zachleat.com/web/comprehensive-webfonts/).

In `app.html` a `<style>` tag associates the fonts with the class `.webfonts`, relying by default on the system font stack.

In terms of JavaScript the `<script/>` tag loads the fonts with the [font loading API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Font_Loading_API).
