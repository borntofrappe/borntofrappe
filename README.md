# Hello World

This is my personal website. Built with [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit), deployed through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

> **Be warned**: the project is a definite work in progress. Expect a lack of polish and a few error messages. SvelteKit is also prone to breaking changes as it sprints toward version 1.0.
