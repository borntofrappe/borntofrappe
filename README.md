![borntofrappe â€” 1st January 2021](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borntofrappe/borntofrappe/master/playground/borntofrappe.svg)

## What's this?

This is meant to be my personal website. Built with 11ty, hosted on netlify, it works as my little corner on the web to shown that I can work as a developer. A front-end web developer, but one that is interested in code beyond HTML, CSS and JavaScript. At the time of writing, for instance, a developer interested in Python, mainly for data analysis, and Lua, mainly for 2D game development.

## What's `playground`?

In the context of this repository, `playground` is a folder dedicated to small, independent demos which are meant to provide the basis, the building blocks for the final website. 11ty is instructed to disregard this folder, and look at the code housed in the `src` folder.

## What happens on the 1st of January?

`1st January 2021` is the arbitrary deadline I gave myself to finally share the website. Netlify already uses the `src` folder to build a websited at borntofrappe.netlify.app, but I am not confident/brave enough to share this work with the world at large. By this date, I hope to muster enough courage to change that.
