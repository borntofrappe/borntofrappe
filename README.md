# Hello World

This is my personal website. Built with [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit), deployed through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Here I try to jot down a note or two as I develop the website.

## Day 1 <!-- Reset -->

### Up and Running

```bash
npm init svelte@next
```

Choices:

- directory not empty... continue!

- Typescript? no

- styling? CSS!

- eslint? why not

- prettier? why not

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
