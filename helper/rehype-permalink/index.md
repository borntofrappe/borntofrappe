# A practical rehype plugin

A third and final example to tie a little bow on the topic of ASTs.

## Hi there

The goal is to add a permalink for subheadings.

### Level

Subheadings ranging between `<h2>` and `<h4>`.

### Why not `<h1>`

I just believe you are more likely to benefit from a reference to subheadings than a pointer to the main title. A preference.

### Why not `<h5>` or `<h6>`

Far too nested! Perhaps a sign that you need to restructure the sections of the document.

Headings might have more than just text. You might have already found a few instances already.
